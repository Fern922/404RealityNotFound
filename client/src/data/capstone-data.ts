            content: "Bohol is a province rich in cultural heritage, boasting iconic landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills, as well as deep-rooted traditions and historical narratives. At the heart of this cultural preservation is the National Museum of the Philippines – Bohol, a vital institution that houses significant artifacts, artworks, and historical items unique to Boholano identity. However, traditional museum presentation methods such as printed labels, static displays, and guided tours often limit visitor engagement and may not fully capture the rich cultural stories behind each exhibit.\n\nIn today's rapidly advancing digital era, people have access to immersive and interactive experiences. Technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) offer a powerful opportunity to bridge historical content with modern interaction. According to Kucharoenthavorn (2024), integrating AR significantly improves historical knowledge and learning engagement among museum visitors.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to develop an AR-based mobile application, Bohol Lens, that transforms traditional museum visits into interactive learning journeys at the National Museum of the Philippines in Bohol. The application will use QR codes placed near the selected artifacts to trigger AR experiences. Through smartphones, users can access 3D reconstructions and multilingual content (English, Filipino, and Bisaya), ensuring accessibility for a more diverse audience.\n\nIn addition to providing enriched educational content, Bohol Lens will feature interactive elements such as folklore stories and fun facts to encourage active learning. This initiative merges technology with heritage preservation to foster a deeper cultural understanding, modernizing the way museums engage with their audiences and enriching the visitor experience.\n\nBy leveraging the capabilities of AR technology, Bohol Lens addresses the limitations of static exhibits, supports the museum's educational mission, and contributes to the preservation and appreciation of Bohol's unique cultural heritage."

It uses Augmented Reality (AR) to bring historical items into the user's physical space, where they can rotate, zoom in, and learn detailed information about each object. The app features 3D models, audio descriptions, and historical facts presented clearly and engagingly.\n\nThis mobile experience enables people—especially students and those far from museums—to engage with cultural heritage in an immersive format. Instead of just reading or watching videos, users can actually 'place' the artifacts in front of them using AR and explore them closely.\n\n**Relevance to this study:** Civilisations AR demonstrates how AR can be utilized to make learning about history and culture more engaging and enjoyable. It inspired the design of Bohol Lens, which also uses 3D models and real-time interaction to promote appreciation for local culture and heritage.\n\n**Reference (APA 7th):** British Broadcasting Corporation.

The development of the Bohol Lens followed the Agile methodology, which involves iterative cycles of planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and review. This allowed the researchers to adapt to changes, implement feedback efficiently, and ensure a user-centered design approach throughout the development of the AR-powered museum.\n\n**Planning Phase (100%)** - The researchers proposed Bohol Lens, an augmented reality-based museum application designed to preserve and promote Boholano culture through immersive interaction with digital exhibits. The system is exclusively developed for Android mobile devices using Unity and Vuforia. High-quality 3D models of cultural artifacts were created using a professional camera and photogrammetry techniques, followed by modeling. During this phase, all technical requirements were defined, including software tools, hardware, and mobile deployment limitations. A multilingual approach was also planned, integrating audio narration in English, Filipino, and Bisaya to cater to a broader audience, especially local users.\n\n**Designing Phase (100%)** - The researchers conducted interviews and collaborative discussions with curators from the National Museum of the Philippines - Bohol, cultural experts, and IT professionals to gather user requirements and expectations. The mobile interface was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, ensuring smooth navigation and easy access to AR content. Wireframes and mockups were created for the AR views, audio controls, and language selection interface. Special attention was given to usability on various Android screen sizes and user environments. UI components were optimized for mobile interaction, and interface elements were prepared to support dynamic switching between English, Filipino, and Bisaya narrations.\n\n**Development Phase (100%)** - The development phase focused on building the AR mobile application using Unity, integrated with the Vuforia SDK for image and marker-based tracking. Photogrammetry-generated 3D models were imported and optimized for real-time rendering on Android devices. Each AR scene was paired with multilingual audio narrations, and a language toggle feature was implemented to allow users to choose their preferred language before viewing the artifacts. All code and assets were version-controlled using GitHub, ensuring maintainability and collaboration during agile sprints. The development also considered offline functionality to ensure accessibility without internet connectivity.\n\n**Testing Phase (100%)** - During the testing phase, the mobile application underwent functional, compatibility, and usability testing across a variety of Android smartphones. AR tracking, model placement accuracy, performance under different lighting conditions, and audio playback for all three languages were thoroughly tested. Bugs and inconsistencies identified during testing were documented and resolved in subsequent development cycles.\n\n**Deployment Phase (100%)** - The final application was packaged and deployed exclusively as an Android APK file. The app was tested on various Android versions to ensure compatibility and performance. All assets, including 3D models and multilingual audio files, were bundled into the APK to support offline use. The deployment process involved direct installation on devices for demonstrations and educational use in schools and public exhibits. The app required no internet connection, making it suitable for remote areas with limited connectivity. The deployment confirmed the system met all functional requirements, including AR stability and multilingual accessibility.\n\n**Review Phase (100%)** - In the review phase, the researchers evaluated the overall performance, usability, and impact of the deployed mobile application. Feedback from initial users indicated strong appreciation for the inclusion of Bisaya and Filipino narrations, which made the experience more engaging and culturally authentic. Minor usability issues and enhancement suggestions, such as clearer audio icons and additional visual guides, were documented for future improvements. The researchers concluded that the mobile-only AR approach was practical for their target audience and would consider future updates to include more artifacts, interactive elements, and possibly additional local dialects."
