 Introduction
Bohol is a province rich in cultural heritage, boasting iconic landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills, as well as deep-rooted traditions and historical narratives. At the heart of this cultural preservation is the National Museum of the Philippines – Bohol, a vital institution that houses significant artifacts, artworks, and historical items unique to Boholano identity. However, traditional museum presentation methods such as printed labels, static displays, and guided tours often provide limited engagement, especially for digital-native visitors and younger generations.
In today's rapidly advancing digital era, people have access to immersive and interactive experiences. Technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) offer a powerful opportunity to bridge historical content with modern interaction. According to  Kucharoenthavorn (2024), integrating AR significantly improves historical knowledge and learning engagement among museum visitors. Using the Immersive Living Museum application, visitors who experienced AR-enhanced exhibits showed higher levels of historical understanding and attraction to learning compared to those using traditional exhibits. The interactive features of AR, including 3D models, animations, sounds, and other multimedia elements, create immersive experiences that make complex historical content more accessible and engaging. By integrating virtual content with real-world exhibits, AR can enhance learning, engagement, and appreciation for cultural heritage.
The primary objective of this study is to develop an AR-based mobile application, Bohol Lens, that transforms traditional museum visits into interactive learning journeys at the National Museum of the Philippines in Bohol. The application will use QR codes placed near the selected artifacts to trigger AR experiences. Through smartphones, users can access 3D reconstructions and multilingual content (English, Filipino, and Bisaya), ensuring accessibility for a more diverse audience. 
In addition to providing enriched educational content, Bohol Lens will feature interactive elements such as folklore stories and fun facts to encourage active learning. This initiative merges technology with heritage preservation to foster a deeper cultural understanding, modernizing the way museums engage with their audiences and enriching the visitor experience. 
By leveraging the capabilities of AR technology, Bohol Lens addresses the limitations of static exhibits, supports the museum’s educational mission, and contributes to the preservation and appreciation of Bohol’s unique cultural heritage.
